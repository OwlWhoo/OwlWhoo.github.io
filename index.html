I'm giving you all: The owl rosen rap,rap,rap,rap - I hatched on the 7th of july, I remember very well that awful day, I was in my egg. curled up tight but i have to say,it was as light as day! Something to do, didn't wanna go, I was so happy not to make a boat! And then I hear some owls give a shout: Whoo cooks for you, who cooks for you! I'm telling you, that was a puzzle to me: I shouted out: how'd you know I'm a WHOO? The owl said: Whoo kooks for you? I popped out my beak and said: now watch me fly! I flapped and flapped, around that room, a whoo kooks for you: a whoo, whoo, whoo - a who, a kooks, a whoo whoo whoo- i'm giving you all: the owl rosen rap. When I was one, I flew into a forest! When I was 2, I ate some owl porridge, when i was 3, I made my own nest, when I was 4, I passed the english test! When I was 5, I ate near a beehive - when I was six, I turned five - when I was seven, i flew into space! When I was 8, I picked up my pace- When I was 9, I went back to the planet- when I was 10, I ate a soapy flannel! So, there are many different kinds of kooks. Most owls are nocturnal. They hunt for food, and mostly eat meat.Owl

Owls are birds from the order Strigiformes, which includes over 200 species of mostly solitary and nocturnal birds of prey typified by an upright stance, a large, broad head, binocular vision, binaural hearing, sharp talons, and feathers adapted for silent flight. Exceptions include the diurnal northern hawk-owl and the gregarious burrowing owl.
Owls hunt mostly small mammals, insects, and other birds, although a few species specialize in hunting fish. They are found in all regions of the Earth except polar ice caps and some remote islands.
Owls are divided into two families: the true (or typical) owl family, Strigidae, and the barn-owl family, Tytonidae.
A group of owls is called a "parliament".[1]
